# react-notification
React toast notification component

## steps to execute
  1. run command "npm run build" to build the project(for this command to work first you need to have npm, babel, webpack installed in your system).
  3. open index.html in a browser.

## points to be noted.
  1. I have already added few notifications while creating the store. extra notifications can be added through the form.
